               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p>
                    I was first introduced to programming in high school. I created my first game written in C++ (a clone of Snake) when I was 16; my life has never been the same. Since then, I have strived to broaden my skills and learn various different way to create and control things with code. 
                    I've created a client facing software in Unity, a RaspberryPi controlled robot that can determine your facial expression using C, and an automated medicine dispenser for a class project runnnig on a PIC microcontroller.
               </p>
               <p>
                    More recently, I have transitioned myself into the career of a web developer. I am formally trained as a Fullstack Engineer in React/Redux and Ruby on Rails, however I do like to dabble with the occasional Node, Python, and UI/UX development. 
               </p>
               <p>
                    I'm always on the lookout for new projects and opportunities. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to <a href="mailto:harsh@hkumar.me" target="_blank">drop me an email</a>.
